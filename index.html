          <p>Marty, are you alright? Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? How's your head? The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. It's my dad.</p>
          <p>See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma.</p>
